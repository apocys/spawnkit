# SpawnKit v2 — The Cathedral Plan

## Vision
Not a product. A masterpiece. The Pantheon of AI management.
Every pixel intentional. Every interaction delightful. Every detail obsessed over.

## The Full Lifecycle (ALL must be perfect)

### 1. DISCOVERY — Landing Page
- [ ] Single-page site that makes people say "I need this NOW"
- [ ] Animated demo GIF/video showing the office alive
- [ ] 3 theme previews (interactive hover)
- [ ] "Pay once, own forever" positioning
- [ ] Testimonial-ready layout
- [ ] One CTA: "Download SpawnKit"

### 2. ACQUISITION — Installer
- [ ] One-click .dmg (macOS) / .exe (Windows)
- [ ] Setup wizard: 3 beautiful screens, zero jargon
- [ ] Auto-detect OpenClaw workspace
- [ ] API key setup with "Test Connection" button
- [ ] Theme selection as part of setup

### 3. FIRST RUN — The "Wow" Moment
- [ ] Boot sequence → office → demo → onboarding
- [ ] Under 10 seconds to "holy shit"
- [ ] First achievement unlocks immediately
- [ ] Welcome message personalized

### 4. DAILY USAGE — The Addiction Loop
- [ ] Open tab → instant office (returning user)
- [ ] Streaks + achievements keep users coming back
- [ ] Q command palette = fastest way to do anything
- [ ] Missions feel like quests
- [ ] Agent personalities make you care

### 5. MASTERY — Power User Features
- [ ] All keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Custom themes (future)
- [ ] Real OpenClaw data integration
- [ ] Agent specialization tracking

### 6. UPDATE — Seamless
- [ ] Auto-update in Electron
- [ ] Changelog shown in-app
- [ ] "What's new" toast after update

## Quality Loops (20 iterations)

### Loop Strategy
- Loops 1-5: Structural issues (architecture, flow, dead code)
- Loops 6-10: UX issues (confusion, friction, missing feedback)
- Loops 11-15: Polish issues (animations, timing, colors, spacing)
- Loops 16-20: Persona testing (3 users, different contexts)

### Personas to Test
1. **Sarah, 28** — Designer, never used CLI, downloads from Product Hunt
   - Can she set up SpawnKit without documentation?
   - Does she understand what she's looking at?
   - Does she share a screenshot within 5 minutes?

2. **Marcus, 35** — Senior developer, uses Claude daily, power user
   - Does Q command palette feel as fast as his terminal?
   - Are keyboard shortcuts intuitive?
   - Does it integrate with his OpenClaw workflow?

3. **Léa, 42** — Startup founder, non-technical, wants AI team
   - Does the landing page convince her to download?
   - Can she send her first mission within 60 seconds?
   - Does she understand the value in one sentence?

## Current State
- 23,816 lines, SS+ grade
- Missing: Landing page, installer polish, persona testing, 20 iteration loops
