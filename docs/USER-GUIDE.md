## Managing Your Team 👥

### Creating a New Agent 🆕

Want to add someone new to your team? It's super easy:

1. **Look for the Big Green Button**: There's a prominent "+" button (usually green) somewhere on your screen
2. **Click It**: One click opens the agent creation form
3. **Give Them a Name**: Something memorable like "Sarah" or "CodeMaster"
4. **Choose Their Role**: What should they specialize in? Writing? Research? Coding? Be creative!
5. **Watch the Magic**: Your new agent appears in the office and starts getting to know the team!

**Pro Tip**: Give your agents fun, memorable names and specific roles. "Emma the Email Expert" is way more fun than "Agent 1"! 😊

### Checking on Agents 🔍

Want to see what your team is up to? Just click on any character in your office:

- **Click Any Agent**: Their character in the office is clickable
- **Status Window Opens**: A detailed card shows what they're working on
- **See Their Progress**: Current task, experience points (XP), and skill level
- **Watch Them Level Up**: As they complete tasks, they gain experience and unlock new abilities
- **Team Dynamics**: Sometimes you'll see agents collaborating on projects together!

Your agents are always busy — even when you're not watching, they're thinking, planning, and getting ready for their next mission!

## Missions 📋

This is where the real magic happens! Missions are how you get things done with your AI team.

### Starting a Mission 🎯

Ready to put your team to work? Here's how:

1. **Open the Sidebar**: Look for the hamburger menu (☰) — three horizontal lines
2. **Click "New Mission"**: Big, obvious button that's hard to miss
3. **Describe What You Need**: Type in plain English! Examples:
   - "Write a funny birthday email for my mom"
   - "Research the best pizza places near me" 
   - "Help me plan a weekend trip to the mountains"
   - "Organize my photos from last vacation"
4. **Hit Send**: Your mission goes to the team command center
5. **Watch Your Agents React**: They'll start moving around, discussing the mission, and getting to work!

**The Golden Rule**: Talk to your agents like you'd talk to a friend. They understand natural language perfectly! 💬

### Tracking Progress 📊

Once a mission is active, you can watch the magic happen:

- **Progress Bars**: The sidebar shows completion percentages for active missions
- **Visual Cues in Office**: Your agents move to different areas based on what they're working on
  - Coding tasks → Computer area
  - Research → Library corner
  - Writing → Desk with papers
- **Team Meetings**: Sometimes you'll see agents gathered together, discussing the mission
- **Real-time Updates**: The progress updates as they work — no refreshing needed!

**Fun Fact**: Your agents work even when you minimize the browser tab. They're dedicated like that! 💪
