# SpawnKit Launch Kit — Ready to Copy & Paste

### Thread 1: The Launch
```
I just built a virtual office for AI agents.

Not a dashboard. Not another admin panel.

An actual pixel art OFFICE where your AI team works at desks, completes quests, and levels up.

Three themes: GameBoy 🎮, Cyberpunk ⚡, Executive 👔

$149 once. No subscriptions. Forever.

```

```
I run 5+ AI agents 24/7. They trade, write, code, monitor, and research.

But every tool to manage them looked like a 90s admin panel.

Terminal logs. JSON blobs. Slack noise.

I thought: what if managing AI agents felt like playing a game?

🧵 2/7
```

```
So I built SpawnKit.

Your agents get pixel art sprites, names, roles, speech bubbles.

You assign missions through a command palette (press Q).

Achievements pop up. Streak counters keep you engaged.

It makes invisible AI work VISIBLE and DELIGHTFUL.

🧵 3/7
```

```
GameBoy theme 🎮

Pokémon-style RPG. Your agents at desks with a quest board.

TRADER, HACKER, BARD, SCRIBE, and WATCHER patrol the office.

Chiptune sounds. 16×16 hand-crafted pixel sprites.

Press START to begin.

🧵 4/7
```

```
Cyberpunk theme ⚡

Neon terminals. Scanline effects. Matrix vibes.

BROKER, CIPHER, GHOST, MAINFRAME, and FIREWALL.

Real-time security monitoring. Everything glows.

🧵 5/7
```

```
Executive theme 👔

For the boardroom crowd. Clean KPIs. Productivity charts.

Morgan, Devon, Blair, Harper, and Quinn.

Succession meets Severance meets AI.

🧵 6/7
```

```
The numbers:
• 32,000+ lines of code
• 15 achievements
• 12 chiptune sound effects
• 3 complete themes
• 0 external dependencies for audio/sprites
• 0 subscriptions

$149. Once. Own it forever.

**Title:** I built a virtual pixel office for AI agents — $149, no subscriptions

I run a fleet of AI agents that work 24/7. Managing them through terminals and JSON was painful. So I built SpawnKit — a visual office where you watch your agents work, assign missions, and earn achievements.

Three themes: GameBoy (pixel RPG), Cyberpunk (neon terminals), Executive (KPI boardroom).

32,000+ lines of handcrafted code. Real data integration via Electron. $149 one-time, no subscriptions.

Would love your feedback!

SpawnKit is a virtual office for your AI agents. Instead of terminal logs, you get pixel art characters working at desks, completing quests, and leveling up.

Three themes, 15 achievements, chiptune sounds, and a Spotlight-style command palette.

Works with OpenClaw and multi-agent systems. $149, no subscriptions.

### r/IndieHacking
**Title:** After 3 days of obsessive building, I shipped SpawnKit — a virtual office for AI agents ($149, no subscriptions)

The story: I run 5 AI agents 24/7. They're incredible workers. But managing them through Slack pings and terminal logs? Boring as hell.

So I built them an office. With pixel art. And quests. And achievements.

The anti-subscription bet: while everyone charges $9-28/user/month, I went one-time $149. I think subscription fatigue is real and people will pay MORE upfront to avoid another monthly charge.

Revenue target: $14.9K-$149K in 90 days.

Feedback welcome!

**Title:** Show HN: SpawnKit – A pixel art virtual office for AI agents ($149, no subscription)

**URL:** https://apocys.github.io/spawnkit-v2/

**Comment:**
Hi HN. I built SpawnKit because managing AI agents through terminals is boring.

SpawnKit gives your AI agents a visual office — three themes (GameBoy pixel RPG, Cyberpunk neon terminals, Executive boardroom), a command palette, and 15 achievements.

It's a desktop Electron app that reads real data from OpenClaw (or shows demo data in the browser). 32K lines of vanilla JS, no frameworks, no external dependencies for audio or sprites.

I went counter-trend with pricing: $149 one-time instead of yet another subscription. The bet is that people are tired of monthly charges and will pay more upfront.

Feedback welcome.
