# SpawnKit v2 — Launch Strategy

## Positioning: "The Anti-Subscription AI Dashboard"

### Core Message
**"Your AI team deserves a better office. Pay once, own forever."**

### Why It Works (3 converging trends)
1. **Subscription fatigue at peak** — consumers rejecting recurring fees (European Business Review 2026)
2. **Nostalgia marketing proven effective** — pixelated aesthetics trigger emotional recall (ACR Journal)
3. **Zero competitors** in gaming-aesthetic AI management space

## Phase 1: Pre-Launch (2 weeks)

### Week 1: Build Buzz

- [ ] **Reddit posts** in r/ChatGPT, r/artificial, r/IndieHackers — "I built a Pokémon-style virtual office for AI agents"

### Week 2: Content Blitz

### Content Angles (pick by platform)

2. **Technical hook** — "30,000 lines, 16 modules, 3 themes, zero frameworks."
3. **Anti-subscription hook** — "$149 once. No monthly fees. No 'enterprise sales calls.'"
4. **Builder story** — "Built entirely by AI agents in one night. Here's the audit trail."

### Moderate (300 sales in 90 days)

## Risk Mitigation
1. **"It's just a demo"** → Ship real API integration before PH launch
2. **"$149 for a dashboard?"** → Emphasize: 3 themes, 15 achievements, keyboard shortcuts, Electron app, offline
3. **"Why not free?"** → "Free tools don't last. We build cathedrals, not sandcastles."
4. **"OpenClaw dependency?"** → Works standalone with mock data, OpenClaw makes it live
